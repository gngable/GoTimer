# GoTimer
Created by Nick Gable with the help of my family

This is a timer designed for fast paced games that last a few seconds to a few minutes and then repeat. 
Just set the time and select Go! The rings around Go disappear while the time is counting down. 
Several color themes and alarm sounds to choose from.
